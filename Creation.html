        <h3>E KŌRERO TĪMATANGA – THE CREATION MYTHOLOGY</h3>
         <div class="container">
         <p>In the beginning there was Te Korekore, the darkness where 
there was potential but as yet no life. Within Te Korekore lived 
Io the Supreme Being, Io who created numerous realms of Po, 
the night. Then the darkness gave way to Te Ata the dawn, from 
which the primal parents Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother and 
Ranginui; the Sky Father came into being. The firm embrace 
within which the parents held each other produced some 
seventy children all of whom became atua (gods). The children 
loved their parents but had to crawl between them and soon 
they yearned for space and light. The atua plotted to forcibly 
separate Papatūānuku and Ranginui with the task literally falling 
upon the shoulders of Tānemahuta, mighty god of the forests. 
At the moment Ranginui and Papatūānuku were parted the 
universe was created. All of the stars and planets came into 
being.</p>

       <h3>PAPATŪĀNUKU – OUR EARTH MOTHER</h3>
       <div class="container">
           <p>In Te Ao Māori the entire earth is known as Papatūānuku the earth Mother. All of her 
mokopuna that dwell upon her (including all the birds and insects of the forest who are her 
grandchildren) depend on her for their wellbeing. People have the option of caring for her 
to maintain their own health or abandoning her. Ultimately an unhealthy Papatūānuku is 
going to lead to unhealthy people. By always keeping in mind the needs of Papatūānuku, 
our people were able to appreciate what would happen to the land (and them) if it was not 
kept in as natural a state as was possible. They only needed to look as far as their own 
bodies to understand how the earth would react if either were not looked after properly. Our kaumātua tell us to take a close 
look at the skin on our body. We can 
see that it is neither smooth nor flat. 
Our skin is like the land, rising and 
falling like the peaks and valleys. This 
is the land, it is Papatūānuku, the land 
and our skin are very similar. They 
then say to look at the hair that​ covers our bodies, the covering that keeps us warm and provides protection just like the 
grasses and trees upon the earth. It does not take long to begin to understand what the 
kaumātua are impressing upon us. They remind us that Tānemahuta covered his mother in a 
cloak of trees and plants to keep her warm; in her cloak he placed his children to accompany 
her. The kaumātua say “look at the hills that have no cloak, Papatūānuku’s skin is left 
unprotected, it will become dry and it will fall away.” Our skin peels after too much sun, it is 
the same as with Papatūānuku, but we call this erosion.</p>

        <h3>RANGINUI – THE SKYFATHER</h3>
         <div class="container">
           <p>Ranginui is our Skyfather, and it is from him that human life and knowledge were said to 
originate. In one tradition, the god Tāne climbed to the citadel Te Tihi-o-Manono, in the 
highest of the 12 heavens, known as Te Toi-o-ngā-rangi. There he retrieved three baskets of 
knowledge: te ketetuatea (basket of light), te kete-tuauri (basket of darkness) and te 
ketearonui (basket of pursuit). There are 
several interpretations of what each 
basket represents. The scholar Māori 
Marsden has suggested that the basket 
of light is present knowledge, the basket 
of darkness things unknown, and the 
basket of pursuit is the knowledge 
               humans currently seek</p>
