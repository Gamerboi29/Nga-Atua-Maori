<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/tawhirimatea.png"></div>
  <div class="grid-item">Tāwhirimatea is the God of 
Wind and the Weather. 
Tāwhirimatea was against 
the separation of his 
parents, and to this day 
stays close to his father.</div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/tanemahuta.png"></div>  
  <div class="grid-item">Tāne Māhuta, the God of the Forest, 
is also the father and God of all who 
dwell in the forests (insects, animals, 
and especially the birds). It was Tāne 
Māhuta who had the strength to 
separate his parents by laying flat on 
his back and pushing up with his 
legs.</div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/tumatauenga.png"></div>
  <div class="grid-item">Tūmatauenga, or Tū, is our God 
of War, and also the God of 
People. After the separation of 
their parents, Tāwhirimātea 
waged war on his brothers. He 
subdued a number of them, but 
Tūmatauenga proved his equal. 
From that time on there has 
been an ongoing battle between 
the weather (Tāwhirimātea) and 
people (Tūmatauenga).</div>  
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/tangaroa.png"></div>
  <div class="grid-item">Tangaroa is the God of the Sea and 
all those who live in the ocea. Māori 
believe that water is an energy, with 
many moods. It can be calm and life
giving, or dangerous and destructive. 
This energy is called Tangaroa. One 
tikanga speaks of never turning your 
back on Tangaroa when by the 
seaside, as this is disrespectful of his 
mana.</div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/rongomatane.png"></div> 
  <div class="grid-item">Rongomatāne is the God of 
Cultivtated food, and the kumara. 
When Tāwhirimātea was venting his 
anger on his brothers, both Rongo and 
Haumiatiketike, took refuge in the 
body of Papa, mother earth, who hid 
them until the storm passed. In the 
Māori language, ‘rongo’ means peace. 
Rongo is generally portrayed as the 
creator of the kūmara, a plant 
associated with peace.</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Haumiatiketike is our God of Uncultivated food. Haumia 
agreed to the forced separation of his parents. Because 
of this he was subjected to the fury of his brother 
Tāwhirimātea, who would have killed him if their 
mother had not hidden him in her body, that is, in the 
ground. While he escaped from Tāwhirimātea, he was 
later discovered by Tū, god of war (here representing 
humankind), who saw Haumia's hair sticking up out of 
the earth. Haumia contrasts with his brother Rongo, the 
god of the kūmara and all cultivated plants.</div>  
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/haumiatiketike.png"></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="Images/ruaumoko.png"></div><div class="grid-col-span2">
      Rūaumoko is the god of earthquakes, volcanoes and seasons 
He is the youngest son of Ranginui and Papatūānuku. After 
Rangi and Papa were separated by their sons, Rangi cried, and 
his tears flooded the land. To stop this, the sons decided to 
turn Papa face down, so Rangi and Papa could no longer see 
each other's sorrow. Rūaumoko was at his mother's breast 
when this happened, so he was carried into the world below. 
He was given fire for warmth by Tama-kaka, and his 
    movements below the earth cause earthquakes and volcanoes</div>
